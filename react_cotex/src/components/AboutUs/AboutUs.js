          This site was created to share Games already on the internet. We donâ€™t crack games and we donâ€™t host games and torrents. All we do is reupload trusted games and releases. We did not make the site thematic, deciding to simply publish various material â€“ games: online, update games, Repack gamesâ€¦ etc.
